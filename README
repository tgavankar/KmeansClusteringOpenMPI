********* How to Run *********
******************************

* graphPoints.py
- Generates clustered 2D points.
Run `python graphPoints.py -c <#> -p <#> -o <file>`
    -c being the desired number of clusters
    -p being the desired number of points per cluster
    -o being the path to the desired output file
    -v being the maximum coordinate value for points (optional)

    
* dnaStrands.py
- Generates clustered DNA strands.
Run `python dnaStrands.py -c <#> -p <#> -o <file>`
    -c being the desired number of clusters
    -p being the desired number of points per cluster
    -o being the path to the desired output file
    -v being the length of each DNA strand (optional, default=10)
    
* sequential.py
- Runs sequential implementation of K-Means and performs profiling.
Run `python sequential.py -k <#> -u <float#> -i <infile> -o <outfile>` for 2D
Run `python sequential.py -t dna -k <#> -u <float#> -i <infile> -o <outfile>` for DNA
    -k being the number of clusters
    -u being the desired number of k-means iterations (usually 0.0001)
    -i being the path to the input file
    -o being the path to the output file
    See report.pdf for output format
    
* distributed.py
- Runs distributed OpenMPI implementation of K-Means and performs per-machine profiling.
- Note: Ensure that your machies are set up correctly for OpenMPI and have mpi4py installed.
Run `mpirun --machinefile <file> -np <#> python distributed.py -k <#> -u <float#> -i <infile> -o <outfile>` for 2D
Run `mpirun --machinefile <file> -np <#> python distributed.py -t dna -k <#> -u <float#> -i <infile> -o <outfile>` for DNA
    --machinefile being the name of the newline-delineated OpenMPI cluster machine hostnames file
    -np being the number of processors to parallelize accross
    -k being the number of clusters
    -u being the desired number of k-means iterations (usually 0.0001)
    -i being the path to the input file
    -o being the path to the output file
    See report.pdf for output format
    
* generateData.sh
- Shell script that generates many different cases of input data.
- Note: This is only for testing purposes. To run the actual tool, invoke them directly as outlined above.

* runSequential.sh
- Shell script that runs all versions of generated data via sequential.py and saves cProfile outputs as well.
- Note: This is only for testing purposes. To run the actual tool, invoke them directly as outlined above.

* runDistributed.sh
- Shell script that runs all versions of generated data via distributed.py and saves cProfile outputs as well.
- Note: This is only for testing purposes. To run the actual tool, invoke them directly as outlined above.
